# ðŸ’» Laptop Price Predictor
This project aims to build a predictive model that estimates laptop prices based on various features such as brand, specifications and other relevant attributes. The goal is to help users and manufacturers understand the factors that influence laptop pricing and to provide a tool for estimating the cost of a laptop given certain specifications.

# ðŸš€ Project Overview
With the rapid advancements in technology, the laptop market is highly competitive and prices can vary significantly based on brand, specifications and other features. This project leverages machine learning algorithms to predict laptop prices using data from various sources.

# Key Features
Feature Extraction: Extract relevant features from the dataset that influence laptop pricing.

Model Training: Use various machine learning algorithms to train models on the dataset.

Model Evaluation: Compare the performance of different models to identify the best one for predicting laptop prices.
# ðŸ§  Algorithms Used
The following machine learning algorithms were used in this project:

Random Forest

XGBoost Regressor

Linear Regression (used as a baseline model)
# Performance Summary
Random Forest: Provided a clear, interpretable model with 87.40% accuracy.

XGBoost Regressor: Outperformed the other models with the highest predictive accuracy 87.62%, making it the best choice for this task.

Linear Regression: Used as a baseline for comparison but less effective in this regression context.
# ðŸ“Š Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes features such as brand, processor type, RAM size, storage capacity, screen size and more. It was sourced from Kaggle and cleaned/preprocessed to ensure high-quality inputs for the model.

# ðŸ“ˆ Model Performance
The models were evaluated based on metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared. The XGBoost Regressor demonstrated superior performance across these metrics, making it the recommended model for this application.
